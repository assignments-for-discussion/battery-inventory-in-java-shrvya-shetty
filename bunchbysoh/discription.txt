The "BunchBySoH" project is a Java application designed to classify and count batteries based on their State of Health (SoH) values. 
This program helps categorize batteries as "healthy," "for exchange," or "failed" based on their SoH % (percenetage).

The main function is :

1)Calculating the SoH for a collection of batteries
2)Classifying each battery into one of the three categories: "healthy" (SoH > 80), "for exchange" (SoH >= 62), or "failed" (SoH < 62).
3)Counting and presenting the number of batteries in each category.
The test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the accuracy of the classification and counting process.
